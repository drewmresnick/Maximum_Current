# Maximum_Current
Python code which extract directional current data from NECOFS FVCOM unstructured grid oceanographic numerical model and calculates mamimum current.

A work in progress to make the code more reproducable and expandable.

Currently the code requires that NetCDF URLs be input directly into the code.

Work is being done to make the code shorter and faster.
